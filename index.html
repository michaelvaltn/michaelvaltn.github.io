  </header>
  <hr>
  <p> Michael (19) is a young university student, currently attending Atma Jaya Catholic University as a
    third-semester undergraduate Accounting student with a current GPA of 3.96. Born in the 21st century and
    domiciled in Jakarta, He is a digital native. Thus he needs to adapt and keep up to the changes in the world,
    including technological changes even though he is an Accounting Student. </p>

  <p> Michael is very passionate about learning new skills that may improve his overall ability and knowledge to work in the future.
    After all, learning is very important to allow Michael to adapt and keep up with the changes he is so concerned about.
    So he currently learns Python programming, SQL, and improving excel skills for business by himself to complement his Accounting
    and Business expertise. He also believes that the improvement of knowledge and skills in technology will allow himself
    to be a better use of technology, which will increase his productivity and work capacity by the time comes. </p>

  <p> His work experience mostly involves researching information, trends, and currently works a lot with data processing in excel.
    Sometimes, he also has to convey the information either by verbal communication or presenting. For these reasons, he is very
    interested to work as a Management Consultant someday. Working as a consultant requires lots of learning and researching, which
    is something that Michael interested in doing. He is comfortable working alone as well as work in teams because he can convey
    his thoughts and information clearly, which makes him suitable to become a consultant. </p>

  <p> However, Michael is still very young and relatively inexperienced in working, so he is looking forward to learning more from
    university, online courses, and e-learning. But most importantly, he wants to gain more opportunities to sharpen what he already
    has and proves himself to be more prepared for the future.  </p>

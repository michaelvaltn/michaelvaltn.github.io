      <p> I'm a young university student, Born in the 21st century and
          domiciled in Jakarta. As a digital native, I must adapt and keep up to the changes in the world,
          including technological changes even though I'm an Accounting Student.
      <br><br>My work experience mostly involves researching information, trends, and currently works a lot with data processing in excel.
          Sometimes, he also has to convey the information either by verbal communication or presenting. For these reasons, he is very
          interested to work as a Management Consultant someday. Working as a consultant requires lots of learning and researching, which
          is something that Michael interested in doing. He is comfortable working alone as well as work in teams because he can convey
          his thoughts and information clearly, which makes him suitable to become a consultant.</p>

        <h2>Why I should learn these?</h2>
        <p>Learning some technical skills will give an advantage and keeps myself productive. Since all company is growing towards digitalizations, I think 
          even non-Computer Science student should learn at least some programming. More importantly, learning it also builds your mind, especially your logical 
          thinking and problem solving, which is a very important soft skills and priced so much by employers.

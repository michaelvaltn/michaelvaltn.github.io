        <p> I'm a young university student, Born in the 21st century and
            domiciled in Jakarta. As a digital native, I must adapt and keep up to the changes in the world,
            including technological changes even though I'm an Accounting Student.
        <br>My previous work experience involves researching and analyzing information, trends, and once works a lot with inputing data and processing in excel.
            The topics that I have researched in my works is about Financial Technology, Financial Literacy, Indonesia's PESTEL (Politics, Economy, Society,
            Technology, Environtment, and Law), and Indonesian Companies' Good Corporate Governance. Communication also involved in my works, as I have to
            discuss and report about my work progress, explain my boss (in my case its my lecturer) about the data and information that i have.</p>

          and the tasks involved allows me to constantly forced to learn and I think it will be a great experience for me. The job itself is considered to be

          in data is growing quickly.</p>

        <p>Javascript is one of the most famous programming language. It is used in web browsers and Javascript is another step to improves my web development skills as it allows
          a more complex interactivity in the webpage that CSS and HTML cannot do. However I don't just learn it for web development, as my Javascript courses also includes data structures
